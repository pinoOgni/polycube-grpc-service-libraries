## Covnerter Cpp (STILL WORK IN PROGESS)

Converter to switch from protobuf messages to C ++ types. In most cases ProtoBuf takes care of this conversion, but, there are cases in which it is necessary to carry out a conversion based on how the data is saved internally in Polycube.

So instead of having the final developer implement the data conversion code on a case-by-case basis, this little library was created.
